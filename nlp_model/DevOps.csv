QUALIFICATIONS
TRAINING, LICENSES, MEMBERSHIPS AND CERTIFICATIONS
Product Owner Certification
Our Ideal Candidate
Product Owner must have a solid vision on what (s)he would like to deliver to clients. This would require the person to have deep understanding of industry trends and client needs and, should be able to weigh in the risks and opportunities. Without this quality, Product Owner may struggle to envision the product which (s)he wants to build for the customer. In large organizations with lot of legacy systems, It is recommended having Product Owner to envision product that delivers something of customer value.
Identify hard trends – things we know will happen
Leverage soft trends – things that might happen
A product owner has foresight - having a sense for the unknown
Minimum Marketable Product (MVP) mindset
At times, Product Owners fall for the budgetary trap. They get tempted to build more features since there is still budget left for consumption. Studies have proven that on an average more than 65% of developed features are never used. This is a case of adding waste into the system. Instead of consuming the budget, focus on only delivering the most valuable features.
Understand the competitive landscape
We live in a highly disruptive market where new products are launched quite often. Product Owner needs to have his/ her eyes and ears on the ground to understand where opportunity arises and take swift decisions.
Communicative and Collaborative
As a Product Owner, the person will need to communicate with diverse set of stakeholders including Development Teams. The person should collaborate with everyone to bring them onboard with the product vision.
Negotiation skills
Collaborating with various stakeholders and Development Teams would need excellent negotiation skills. This will also help avoid delays in decision-making. When stakeholders skip Sprint Reviews, it is a classic sign of dis-engaged Product Owner.
Release frequently
Business value perceived by Product Owner is only a hypothesis unless it is released to the market. By not releasing frequently, he/she will just lengthen the feedback loop from the customers and miss the opportunity to take necessary tactical decisions about the product.
What are we looking for?
We are looking for talented individuals who can be effective leaders with functional and operational expertise. You must be a strong communicator who builds trust-based relationships within the squad and amongst stakeholders. If you possess traits and experience that match most of the below, we’d love to hear from you:
10+ year experience and proven knowledge in the Digital Banking, especially Online Banking, Mobile Banking, Wearables or any other digital channels or devices.
10+ years in Agile as a Product Owner (or a similar role), strong skills of maintaining and prioritizing a backlog
Deep understanding of industry trends and client needs, ability to create a value proposition and a squad vision
Strong business acument
Demonstrated track record of leading teams to deliver objectives
Previously coached and mentored team members with regular feedback sessions
Previously defined product requirements and development roadmap based on functional expertise
Strong prioritization and analytical skills to manage backlog for the squad
Strong communication skills to synchronize tasks, clarify requirements and delivery expectations with stakeholders
Good to have knowledge of design thinking frameworks, user stories, customer experience and journeys

QUALIFICATIONS
TRAINING, LICENSES, MEMBERSHIPS AND CERTIFICATIONS
Product Owner Certification
Our Ideal Candidate
Product Owner must have a solid vision on what (s)he would like to deliver to clients. This would require the person to have deep understanding of industry trends and client needs and, should be able to weigh in the risks and opportunities. Without this quality, Product Owner may struggle to envision the product which (s)he wants to build for the customer. In large organizations with lot of legacy systems, It is recommended having Product Owner to envision product that delivers something of customer value.
Identify hard trends – things we know will happen
Leverage soft trends – things that might happen
A product owner has foresight - having a sense for the unknown
Minimum Marketable Product (MVP) mindset
At times, Product Owners fall for the budgetary trap. They get tempted to build more features since there is still budget left for consumption. Studies have proven that on an average more than 65% of developed features are never used. This is a case of adding waste into the system. Instead of consuming the budget, focus on only delivering the most valuable features.
Understand the competitive landscape
We live in a highly disruptive market where new products are launched quite often. Product Owner needs to have his/ her eyes and ears on the ground to understand where opportunity arises and take swift decisions.
Communicative and Collaborative
As a Product Owner, the person will need to communicate with diverse set of stakeholders including Development Teams. The person should collaborate with everyone to bring them onboard with the product vision.
Negotiation skills
Collaborating with various stakeholders and Development Teams would need excellent negotiation skills. This will also help avoid delays in decision-making. When stakeholders skip Sprint Reviews, it is a classic sign of dis-engaged Product Owner.
Release frequently
Business value perceived by Product Owner is only a hypothesis unless it is released to the market. By not releasing frequently, he/she will just lengthen the feedback loop from the customers and miss the opportunity to take necessary tactical decisions about the product.
What are we looking for?
We are looking for talented individuals who can be effective leaders with functional and operational expertise. You must be a strong communicator who builds trust-based relationships within the squad and amongst stakeholders. If you possess traits and experience that match most of the below, we’d love to hear from you:
10+ year experience and proven knowledge in the Digital Banking, especially Online Banking, Mobile Banking, Wearables or any other digital channels or devices.
10+ years in Agile as a Product Owner (or a similar role), strong skills of maintaining and prioritizing a backlog
Deep understanding of industry trends and client needs, ability to create a value proposition and a squad vision
Strong business acument
Demonstrated track record of leading teams to deliver objectives
Previously coached and mentored team members with regular feedback sessions
Previously defined product requirements and development roadmap based on functional expertise
Strong prioritization and analytical skills to manage backlog for the squad
Strong communication skills to synchronize tasks, clarify requirements and delivery expectations with stakeholders
Good to have knowledge of design thinking frameworks, user stories, customer experience and journeys
